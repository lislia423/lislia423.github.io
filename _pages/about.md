Hello! I'm Lisa, a third year computer science PhD candidate at Washington University in St.Louis. I am broadly interested in extracting insights from multi-omics data to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying various phenotypes. My current research interest focuses on building explainable models to predict complex traits in aging.
